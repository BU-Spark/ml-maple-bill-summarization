"An Act establishing a sick leave bank for Christopher Trigilio, an employee of the trial court","Summary: An Act establishing a sick leave bank for Christopher Trigilio, an employee of the trial court. This bill mandates the establishment of a sick leave bank specifically for Christopher Trigilio, an employee of the trial court, overriding any existing general or special laws. Other employees of the trial court are allowed to voluntarily donate their sick, personal, or vacation days to this bank for Trigilio's use. If Trigilio ends his employment or requests to dissolve the sick leave bank, any remaining days will be transferred to the trial court paid leave bank. The use of these sick leave bank days is strictly limited to absences related to the illness or disability that led to the creation of the sick leave bank, as determined by the trial court."
An Act providing living organ donor protections,"Summary: An Act providing living organ donor protections. This bill aims to protect the rights of living organ donors in the insurance sector. It mandates that insurance companies cannot decline, limit, or discriminate in coverage based on a person's status as a living organ donor. The bill also prohibits insurance providers from preventing a person from donating an organ as a condition of maintaining their coverage. The legislation further requires the commissioner of insurance to enforce these rules and the department to make materials related to live organ donation available to the public. Violations of these provisions are considered unfair competition or deceptive practices."
An Act authorizing the State Board of Retirement to grant creditable service to Paul Lemelin,"Summary: An Act authorizing the State Board of Retirement to grant creditable service to Paul Lemelin. This bill allows the state board of retirement to credit Paul Lemelin, an employee of the Franklin Regional Council of Governments, with service time for the period from November 14, 2011 to January 20, 2023.
