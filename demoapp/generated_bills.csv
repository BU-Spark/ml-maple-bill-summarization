H20, An Act clarifying and normalizing non-public school service purchases,"Summary: An Act clarifying and normalizing non-public school service purchases is a bill that aims to allow members of a contributory retirement system who were previously employed as teachers in special education programs for school-aged children in non-public schools in the Commonwealth to establish such service as creditable service. The bill outlines the terms and conditions for making a deposit into the annuity savings fund of the system in order to receive credit for the previous non-public school service. It also defines ""non-public school"" as an institution operated by a private entity in the Commonwealth that will lead to or award school-aged children either a high school diploma or its equivalent, excluding activities in a residence or afterschool program. The maximum credit for service in non-public schools is capped at ten years, and no credit or payment is allowed for service for which the member is entitled to receive a retirement allowance, annuity, or pension from any other source. Additionally, the bill specifies that if the service rendered in public schools of the Commonwealth is less than the service in non-public schools for which the member has paid, credit shall be allowed only for the most recent service rendered in non-public schools equal to such service rendered in public schools, and the amount paid for such additional service shall be refunded with accumulated interest.",Education,"1.
