An Act providing living organ donor protections,"Summary: An Act providing living organ donor protections is a legal bill that amends various sections of the General Laws to protect living organ donors.

 An Act relative to vehicle recalls,"Summary: An Act relative to vehicle recalls aims to address safety concerns related to open safety recalls on motor vehicles. The bill introduces a new section, Section 7A 1/2, to Chapter 90 of the General Laws. It defines ""open safety recall"" as a safety-related recall that requires repairs or modifications to be performed by an authorized dealer, excluding certain recalls related to labeling or notifications in an owner's manual or recalls where the manufacturer repurchases the vehicle or provides financial compensation to the owner.

Under this bill, the registry of motor vehicles is required to check information provided by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration before issuing or renewing a motor vehicle registration. If a vehicle is subject to one or more open safety recalls, the owner must be provided with a written notice detailing the recalls. The notice must include a description of each recall and inform the owner that the repairs can be done by an approved dealer at no cost, except as provided by federal law. The registration certificate for a motor vehicle will not be issued until all open safety recalls are repaired, as per the provisions of the bill.

Owners of motor vehicles must obtain the necessary repairs before the next registration renewal, as failure to do so will result in the denial of the registration renewal application. The Registrar is also required to send a notice to consumers between 50 and 80 calendar days before their registration expires, listing any open safety recalls that need to be addressed for vehicle re-registration.

However, there are exemptions to the denial of registration for vehicles subject to open safety recalls. These exemptions include situations where the manufacturer has not made a remedy available, necessary replacement parts are not readily available, the vehicle requires additional repairs not covered by the recall, the customer has installed modifications preventing the remedy application, or if the Registrar determines that circumstances beyond the owner's control or undue hardship prevented recall remediation.

It is important to note that this bill does not alter the liability of manufacturers or motor vehicle franchise dealers under common law."
