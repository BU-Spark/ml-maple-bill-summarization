An Act providing living organ donor protections,"Summary: An Act providing living organ donor protections. This bill aims to protect the rights of living organ donors in the insurance sector. It mandates that the commissioner of insurance establish rules to enforce sections of various chapters related to insurance. The bill also requires the department to make available to the public any materials related to live organ donation from reputable organizations. It prohibits insurance providers from declining or limiting coverage, or discriminating in any way against a person solely based on their status as a living organ donor. This applies to policies against disability, life insurance, group or individual annuity, pure endowment contract, and long-term care insurance. Any violation of these provisions is considered an unfair method of competition or an unfair or deceptive act or practice."
