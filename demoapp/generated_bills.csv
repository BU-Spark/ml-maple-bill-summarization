"An Act establishing a sick leave bank for Christopher Trigilio, an employee of the trial court","Summary: An Act establishing a sick leave bank for Christopher Trigilio, an employee of the trial court. This bill mandates the establishment of a sick leave bank specifically for Christopher Trigilio, an employee of the trial court, overriding any existing general or special laws. Other employees of the trial court are allowed to voluntarily donate their sick, personal, or vacation days to this bank for Trigilio's use. If Trigilio ends his employment or requests to dissolve the sick leave bank, any remaining time will be transferred to the trial court paid leave bank. The use of the sick leave bank days is strictly for absences related to the illness or disability that led to the creation of the bank, as determined by the trial court."
